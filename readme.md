Jem-press is inspired by [Octopress][octo] and [jem-doc][jem], hence the name.
I like Octopress for all the customization and options, but it's lacking
deliberately feature-poor simplicity of jem-doc. However, jem-doc doesn't use
markdown, and seems kinda hacked together (no make file included, etc). So, I
decided to make jem-press.

Octopress is a blog-aware site generator. Jem-press is not, and could only be
blog aware if you formatted the blog yourself. In that sense, it's static. A
good example of the site I'm trying to produce is [the jemdoc website][jem].

Jem-press is supposed to be *simple.* It's designed so that all that's required
is to download this repo and change the markdown files. Everything else is
taken care of -- CSS, LaTeX equations, etc. Extensive documentation can be
found on the wiki.
