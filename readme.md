Features
=========

* simple, feature minimal (deliberately!)
* easy to pick up
* popular markdown formatting
* easy for academic/static sites


What I envision
===============
* `ruby update` goes from .md (in a special folder!) to a complete site in
  html/
* Have it so it's easy to get started
    * solely writing markdown will get you started (source folder includes
      header images)
    * but easily customizable: can change theme *easily* by altering
      header/footer/style


Directory structure
===================
    source/
        *.md
        images/
    theme/
        style.css
        header.html
        footer.html
    ruby_make
    html/
        *.html
        images/
