<p>Two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>git clone https://github.com/scottsievert/jem-press/</code></li>
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/scottsievert/jem-press/archive/master.zip">this zip file</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will include a sample site, providing you with an example and making it
easier to edit.</p>

<h2 id="filestructure">File structure</h2>

<ul>
<li>The content of your site is in <code>content/</code>. Here, each <code>.md</code> file is a
 different page (except <code>menu.md</code>) and is written in the Markdown markup
 language.</li>
<li><code>index.md</code> will be the homepage (browsers default to index.html)</li>
<li>Markdown is a markup language that (besides being wonderful) also accepts
 <em>any</em> HTML (which can help with making something look <em>exactly</em> like you
 want).</li>
</ul>

<p>For more help, look at the rest of the site.</p>
