<p>Editing the CSS file is hard to learn at first. The page <code>page.html</code> includes
some class and id tags. Anything with an <code>id=this_tag</code> reads off <code>#this_tag {
...}</code> and anything with <code>class=this_tag</code> reads off <code>.this_tag</code>. Paragraph tags
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and link tags <code>&lt;a ...&gt;</code> read of <code>a {...}</code> and <code>p {...}</code> respectively. The
<code>a</code> tag has some different options for hover/visited/etc. I found that if I was
trying to edit a specific property, it was helpful to set something obvious
like <code>.some_tag { color: red }</code> to see which area I was editing.</p>

<p>Several styles are included in <code>helper/header.html</code>. Uncomment the lines that
include both the solarized dark and light schemes. This may require some
editing of style.css on your part. But, it&#8217;s fairly basic editing that only
includes colors and heights. If you have any questions, contact me.</p>
