<p>Editing the CSS file is hard to learn at first. The page <code>page.html</code> includes some class and id tags. Anything with an <code>id=this_tag</code> reads off <code>#this_tag { ...}</code> and anything with <code>class=this_tag</code> reads off <code>.this_tag</code>. Paragraph tags <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and link tags <code>&lt;a ...&gt;</code> read of <code>a {...}</code> and <code>p {...}</code> respectively. The <code>a</code> tag has some different options for hover/visited/etc. I found that if I was trying to edit a specific property, it was helpful to set something obvious like <code>.some_tag { color: red }</code> to see which area I was editing.</p>
<p>Several styles are included in <code>helper/header.html</code>. Uncomment the lines that include both the solarized dark and light schemes. This may require some editing of style.css on your part. But, it's fairly basic editing that only includes colors and heights. If you have any questions, contact me.</p>
