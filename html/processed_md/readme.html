<p>Jem-press is inspired by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/index.html">jem-doc</a>, hence the name.
I like Octopress for all the customization and options, but it&#8217;s lacking
deliberately feature-poor simplicity of jem-doc. However, jem-doc doesn&#8217;t use
markdown, and seems kinda hacked together (no make file included, etc). So, I
decided to make jem-press.</p>

<p>Octopress is a blog-aware site generator. Jem-press is not, and could only be
blog aware if you formatted the blog yourself. In that sense, it&#8217;s static. A
good example of the site I&#8217;m trying to produce is <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/index.html">the jemdoc website</a>.</p>

<p>Jem-press is supposed to be <em>simple.</em> It&#8217;s designed so that all that&#8217;s required
is to download this repo and change the markdown files. Everything else is
taken care of &#8211; CSS, LaTeX equations, etc. Extensive documentation can be
found on the wiki.</p>
