<h2 id="jem-press">jem-press</h2>

<p>You want to create a simple website. You don&#8217;t want to mess around with any
GUIs and look at <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and other blog-sensitive
<a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net">site generators</a>, but they&#8217;re not right. You look at <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/">jemdoc</a>,
<a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start">harp</a> and <a href="http://wintersmith.io">wintersmith</a>, but they all seem too complex (though
jemdoc the least complex). You just want to write your content, have it look
decent by default and publish it. You don&#8217;t want to mess around with themes or CSS files.</p>

<p>jem-press does just that. It takes content written with Markdown and makes a
static (and not blog-sensitive) website that looks something like
<a href="http://scottsievert.github.io/jem-press/">this</a> without any configuration. Good examples of sites that
could use this are academic websites, as they&#8217;re normally just a bunch of
static pages.</p>

<p>jem-press was inspired by <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/">jemdoc</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> (and
hence the name). The main differences are jem-press uses the popular Markdown
and requires no configuration: you just start writing content.</p>

<p>jem-press is designed to be <em>easy.</em> Complexity hurts ease&#8230; or you could say
ease is inversely proportional to complexity, hence the menu image. This site
generator is designed for you to create a site with ease and to customize the
site with almost equal ease.</p>
