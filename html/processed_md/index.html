<p>This is an alternative to <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/">jemdoc</a>, a static site generator. jemdoc is a simple
site generator, suitable for putting a couple pages up on the internet (neither
jemdoc or jempress are meant for blogs).</p>

<p>jemdoc provided inspiration (academic sites, nice layout) but I personally did
not like the implementation. jemdoc defined it&#8217;s own markup language and embeds
latex as PNGs (avoided with <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~wsshin/jemdoc+mathjax.html">jemdoc+mathjax</a>). I decided to make my own
implementation of jemdoc but using Markdown, MathJax and jQuery. These tools
result in a clean solution.</p>

<p>jempress is simple to generate a site with. You write your content in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example">Markdown</a>, run <code>ruby update.rb</code> and your site is in <code>html/</code>,
completely formatted. Prime candidates seem to be simple and blog-free
websites, such as academic websites.</p>

<p>jem-press is designed to be <em>easy.</em> This site generator is designed for you to
create a site with ease and to customize the site with slightly less ease. If
you&#8217;re interested in drastically changing the formatting of this site,
jem-press is not for you.</p>
