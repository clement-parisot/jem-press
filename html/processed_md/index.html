<p>You want to create a simple website. You don&#8217;t want to mess around with any
GUIs and look at <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and other blog-sensitive
<a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net">site generators</a>, but they&#8217;re not right. You look at <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/">jemdoc</a>,
<a href="http://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start">harp</a> and <a href="http://wintersmith.io">wintersmith</a>, but they all seem too complex (though
jemdoc the least complex). You just want to write your content, have it look
decent and publish it. You don&#8217;t want to mess around with themes or CSS files.</p>

<p>jem-press does just that. It takes content written with Markdown and
makes a static (and not blog-sensitive) website that looks something like
[this][jem-press-ex].</p>

<p>jem-press was inspired by <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/">jemdoc</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> (and
hence the name). The main differences are jem-press uses the popular Markdown
and requires no configuration: you just start writing content.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Usability &#8211; jem-press takes content written in Markdown and publishes that
 content with a CSS file. No configuration is necessary (although can be
 added!).</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span> equation support</li>
</ul>
