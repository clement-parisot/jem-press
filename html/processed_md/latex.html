<h3 id="latex">Latex</h3>

<p>Latex is what people use to write pretty mathematical expressions. If you&#8217;re
still reading, you probably know what latex is and don&#8217;t need a primer.</p>

<p>jem-press supports latex, through MathJax. This means you can use <code>$</code> and <code>$$</code>
like you normally would in latex.</p>

<p>MathJax even supports equation numbering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 \label{eq} \end{equation}\]</span>
Equation <span class="math">\(\ref{eq}\)</span> is perhaps the most powerful equation. It involves the two most important
numbers, 0 and 1. It involves two irrational numbers, <span class="math">\(e\)</span> and $\pi$. It
involves $j=\sqrt{&#8211;1}$, a number that&#8217;s almost imaginary!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which was generated by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; $$\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 
    \label{eq} \end{equation}$$
Equation $\ref{eq}$ ...
