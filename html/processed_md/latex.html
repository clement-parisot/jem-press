<h2 id="latex">Latex</h2>

<p>Latex is what people use to write pretty mathematical expressions. If you&#8217;re
still reading, you probably know what latex is and don&#8217;t need a primer.</p>

<p>jem-press supports latex, through MathJax. This means you can use <code>$</code> and <code>$$</code>
like you normally would in latex.</p>

<p>MathJax even supports equation numbering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 \label{eq} \end{equation}\]</span></p>

<p>Equation <span class="math">\(\ref{eq}\)</span> is perhaps the most powerful equation. It contains two
irrational numbers, two rational and important numbers and one imaginary
number!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which was generated by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; $$\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 
    \label{eq} \end{equation}$$

Equation $\ref{eq}$ ...
</code></pre>
