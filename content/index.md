## jem-press

You want to create a simple website. You don't want to mess around with any
GUIs and look at [Octopress][octo], [Jekyll][jekyll] and other blog-sensitive
[site generators][site], but they're not right. You look at [jemdoc][jemdoc],
[harp][harp] and [wintersmith][winter], but they all seem too complex (though
jemdoc the least complex). You just want to write your content, have it look
decent by default and publish it. You don't want to mess around with themes or CSS files.

jem-press just does that. You write your content in Markdown, run `ruby
update.rb` and boom. Your site is in `html`, completely formatted. Prime
candidates seem to be simple and blog-free websites, such as academic websites.

jem-press is designed to be *easy.* Complexity and ease seem to opose each
other. This site generator is designed for you to create a site with ease and to
customize the site with almost equal ease (or certainly less pain than before).

jem-press was inspired by [jemdoc][jemdoc] and [octopress][octo] (and hence the
name). The main differences are jem-press uses the popular Markdown and
requires no configuration: you just start writing content. jemdoc uses a
not-very-popular markup syntax and requires some initial setup. Octopress is
easy to use but is blog aware and doesn't seem right for these simple website.
If the two had a child, they would name it jem-press.


## Features
* simple, feature minimal (deliberately!)
* mobile friendly
* no configuration necessary. However, CSS file is well commented (and
  hopefully easy to modify).
* popular markdown formatting
* easy for academic/static sites
* not blog sensitive
* $\LaTeX$ equation support
