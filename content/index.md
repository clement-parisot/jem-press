# jem-press
This is an alternative to [jemdoc], a static site generator. jemdoc is a simple
site generator, suitable for putting a couple pages up on the internet (neither
jemdoc or jempress are meant for blogs).

jemdoc provided inspiration (academic sites, nice layout) but I personally did
not like the implementation. jemdoc defined it's own markup language and embeds
latex as PNGs (avoided with [jemdoc+mathjax]). I decided to make my own
implementation of jemdoc but using Markdown, MathJax and jQuery. These tools
result in a clean solution.

jempress is simple to generate a site with. You write your content in
[Markdown][markdown], run `ruby update.rb` and your site is in `html/`,
completely formatted. Prime candidates seem to be simple and blog-free
websites, such as academic websites.

jem-press is designed to be *easy.*  This site generator is designed for you to
create a site with ease and to customize the site with slightly less ease. If
you're interested in drastically changing the formatting of this site,
jem-press is not for you.

## Features of jempress
* $\LaTeX$ equation support with [MathJax] (see? $e^{j\pi} = -1$)
* Popular formatting language [Markdown] (as used on
  Reddit/GitHub/StackOverflow/more)
* designed as alternative to [jemdoc]
* mobile friendly
* simple, feature minimal (deliberately!)
* no configuration necessary

## Other static site generators
* [jemdoc]
* [Octopress][octo]
* [Jekyll][jekyll]
* [harp]
* [wintersmith][winter]
* and there's also a list of other [static site generators][site]...
