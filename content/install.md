## Install
Two options:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/scottsievert/jem-press/`
2. Download [this zip file][zip].

This will include a sample site, providing you with an example and making it
easier to edit.

## File structure
* The content of your site is in `content/`. Here, each `.md` file is a
  different page (except `menu.md`) and is written in the Markdown markup
  language.
* `index.md` will be the homepage (browsers default to index.html)
* Markdown is a markup language that (besides being wonderful) also accepts
  *any* HTML (which can help with making something look *exactly* like you
  want).

For more help, look at the rest of the site.
