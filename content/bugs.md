## Bugs
* The menu background color doesn't go to the bottom of the screen if content
  lengthy (ie, as in [getting started](getting_started.html)).
* No dates in footer.

## Versions
* 0.11: Menu image centered, footer bug fixed.
* 0.1: Initial release, almost ready for consumption. Docs in decent shape,
  command-line options working, mobile-friendly, $\LaTeX$ support and more. To
  add:
    * move menu column background to bottom of page, regardless of content
      height.
    * center menu image
