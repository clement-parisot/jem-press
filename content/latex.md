### Latex
Latex is what people use to write pretty mathematical expressions. If you're
still reading, you probably know what latex is and don't need a primer.

jem-press supports latex, through MathJax. This means you can use `$` and `$$`
like you normally would in latex.

MathJax even supports equation numbering.

> $$\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 \label{eq} \end{equation}$$
Equation $\ref{eq}$ is perhaps the most powerful equation. It involves the two most important
numbers, 0 and 1. It involves two irrational numbers, $e$ and $\pi$. It
involves $j=\sqrt{-1}$, a number that's almost imaginary!

Which was generated by the following code:

    > $$\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 
        \label{eq} \end{equation}$$
    Equation $\ref{eq}$ ...
