## Latex
Latex is what people use to write pretty mathematical expressions. If you're
still reading, you probably know what latex is and don't need a primer.

jem-press supports latex, through MathJax. This means you can use `$` and `$$`
like you normally would in latex.

MathJax even supports equation numbering.

> $$\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 \label{eq} \end{equation}$$

> Equation $\ref{eq}$ is perhaps the most powerful equation. It contains two
irrational numbers, two rational and important numbers and one imaginary
number!

Which was generated by the following code:

```
> $$\begin{equation} \exp\left[j\pi\right] + 1 = 0 
    \label{eq} \end{equation}$$

Equation $\ref{eq}$ ...
```
